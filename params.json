I decided to create this site to allow my class to practice for this weekly test (conjugation and French translation). \r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nClick \"Test!\" then \"Test traditionnel\". Fill in the fields then click \"Rendre la copie\" and get a mark.\r\nAll the marks are stored in \"Scores\".\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n\r\n![screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maarti/iverbs/gh-pages/images/iverbs_screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n[Maarti](http://maarti.net)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT License\r\n",
